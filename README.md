==============================

Display Output Post-Processing (DOPP) is an AMD OpenGL extension 
that lets users of AMD FirePro workstation cards grab the desktop directly 
as a texture and manipulate it in an almost infinite number of ways 
before it is output to a display system. 

This SDK contains:
- an open source DOPP sample.
- the DOPPenable.exe tool.
